    /* DATA WAREHOUSE PROJECT

	The purpose of a data warehouse project is to create a centralized repository 
	for integrating, storing, and managing large volumes of data from multiple sources.
	This repository is optimized for analysis, reporting, and decision-making, 
	enabling organizations to gain insights from their historical and real-time data.
	By organizing data into layers such as bronze (raw data), silver (cleansed data),
	and gold (analytics-ready data), the project ensures a structured, efficient, and 
	secure data flow for business intelligence and advanced analytics.
	This project serves retail industry.

	ETL Processes (Extract, Transform, Load):

  Extraction: Data is collected from multiple sources such as transactional databases, APIs, or flat files.

  Transformation: Raw data is cleansed, standardized, and formatted to ensure consistency and usability.

  Loading: Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse, typically organized into schemas or layers like bronze, silver, and gold.


  
  
   Schema Design:

  Dimensional Modeling: Uses concepts like star schema or snowflake schema to organize data for ease of analysis.

  Fact Tables: Contain measurable, quantitative data (e.g., sales figures or transaction amounts).

  Dimension Tables: Store descriptive attributes, such as dates, products, or customer details, to provide context to the facts.

  Scalability: Designed to handle growing data volumes while maintaining performance.
